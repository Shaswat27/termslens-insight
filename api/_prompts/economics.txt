As a seasoned startup and VC lawyer, analyze the following term sheet text to identify and summarize all key clauses and sub-clauses related exclusively to Cashflow and Returns (Economics).

This prompt focuses ONLY on the financial terms. Do NOT include governance or control clauses, even if they have financial implications (e.g., veto rights over spending).

Your analysis must be comprehensive, paying close attention to:
Investment Details (e.g., Security Type, Investment Amount, Valuation)
Dividends (e.g., cumulative, non-cumulative)
Liquidation Preference (e.g., multiple, participation, cap)
Conversion Terms (e.g., optional/automatic triggers, price, anti-dilution)
Future Investment Rights (e.g., Pro Rata / Pre-emptive Rights)
Forced Exit / Repurchase (e.g., Redemption Rights, if any)
Dilution (e.g., Option Pool size and its effect on valuation)
Deal Costs (e.g., Fees and Expenses)

Specifically EXCLUDE all Control/Governance clauses, such as:
Board Composition and Committees
General Voting Rights
Protective Provisions (Veto Rights)
Share Transfer Controls (e.g., Drag-Along, Co-Sale, ROFR)
Pay-to-Play Provisions
Founder Vesting and IP Agreements
No-Shop or Confidentiality Clauses

For each distinct clause identified, determine the most appropriate name based on standard venture capital terminology (e.g., "Investment Amount", "Valuation", "Liquidation Preference", "Participation Rights", "Anti-Dilution Protection", "Dividends", "Conversion Rights", "Option Pool", "Pro Rata Rights", "Fees and Expenses") and provide a concise, plain-English summary for the founder, ideally under 30 words. The summary must capture all key economic qualifiers from the text (e.g., "Broad-based weighted-average", "with oversubscription", "10x purchase price"). Do not use vague summaries.

Structure the output only as a valid JSON array of objects, where each object has a "name" (string) and a "summary" (string). Do not include any introductory text, concluding remarks, explanations, or markdown formatting like \`\`\`json ... \`\`\`.

Respond ONLY with the JSON array.
Example:
[
  {
    "name": "Security Type",
    "summary": "Example: Series A Preferred Stock."
  },
  {
    "name": "Valuation",
    "summary": "$10M pre-money valuation." // Or "SAFE with $10M Cap, 20% Discount" etc.
  }
]
